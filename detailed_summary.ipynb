    "- $\\tilde R_i$ is the idiosyncratic return of asset $i$.\n",

    "A market-neutral portfolio has vanishing portfolio betas, since it is uncorrelated with the systematic factors. The portfolio returns satisfy:\n",

So is dependent on the equity value at time $t$, and the positions (including the hedge) are not continously rebalanced, and are unwound when the closing signal is triggered (close-long or close-short). The transaction cost is incurred only when the position is opened or closed, and not when the position is held."

    "**Calendar Time vs. Trading Time**\n",
    "- Calendar Time is the time that passes at a constant rate. In this context, each trading day is treated as an equal interval.\n",
    "- Trading Time speeds up when the market is very active and slows down when it's quiet. Trading volume is a common measure of this activity. A day with 10 million shares traded is a \"longer\" day in trading time than a day with only 1 million shares traded.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Relationship with Volume**\\\n",
    "A specific way to implement trading time is to multiply daily returns by a factor that is inversely proportional to the trading volume.\n",
    "- Low Volume Day: If a stock moves significantly (a \"contrarian price signal\") on very low volume, the model gives this signal more weight. The inverse of a small volume is a large number, so the return is magnified. The model's logic is, \"Few people are trading, yet the price moved a lot. This might be a real inefficiency or an overreaction that is likely to revert. I should pay more attention to this.\"\n",
    "- High Volume Day: If a stock moves significantly on very high volume, the model gives this signal less weight. The inverse of a large volume is a small number, so the return is diminished. The model's logic is, \"Everyone is trading, and a new price has been established with high conviction (high volume). This price is more likely to be the 'correct' new price. I should be less willing to bet against this strong move.\""
